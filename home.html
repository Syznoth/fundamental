        <p>Hi, I’m Thi Ha Tun, a dedicated UI/UX Designer focused on crafting intuitive, user-centric digital experiences. I specialize in bridging the gap between complex functionality and seamless visual design to create products that are both beautiful and functional. Currently, I am open to collaborations with developers and product teams to bring innovative ideas to life, offering services in user research, wireframing, high-fidelity prototyping, and interface design.</br>
            Looking ahead, my future plan involves mastering motion design and exploring the intersection of AI and human-centric interfaces to stay at the forefront of the industry. My commitment is to always advocate for the end-user, ensuring every pixel serves a purpose and every interaction adds genuine value to the user journey.
